# MoodieFoodie
*...Food for every Mood*

This is a web application which recommends you food based on your mood and delivers it to your doorstep.

We understand that the first thought that comes to our mind when we come across a food suggesting and delivery app, is obviously- "HOW IS THIS SOMETHING NEW?"

We'll explain.
This web application is based on an absolutely new idea and is completely different from the traditional food delivery websites.

Firstly, it suggests a list of restaurants combining three basic parameters i.e cost, user rating and distance, all at the same time. Hence, it offers you the most optimal choice available, saving you the trouble of choosing the best restaurant for you using individual filters on traditional apps. 
The most commonly used apps allow you to choose a restaurant on the basis of only a single critera at a time, but we recommend you the nearest, most affordable and best quality restaurants, thereby catering to all your demands at the same time without having you to compromise on any of them.

Secondly, we understand that there are times when you are unable to decide what to order. Infact, we have personally faced this dilemma a hundred times when we've spent hours scrolling a food delivery app, thinking about the most important question which seems to have been given the least importance uptil now , "WHAT TO EAT?" 
MoodieFoodie helps you to choose a food item for all your moods, be it a happie, a sadie, an angrie, a dehydratie, a depressie, an excitie or an unwellie mood ;")
Whatever be your mood, we can always suggest you food!

The app uses previous user moods and their respective food orders to suggest the best food choice for you.

Thirdly, we offer several other options for food ordering like the list of food items ordered the most at a particular time of the day or the restaurants that can order food in the minimum time if you're really hungry or the top searched food items, etc.

And lastly, this app allows you to order the food items that traditional food delivery apps don't.
You can order tea, juices or even chocolates. For this, we have a separate "Wanna sell on MoodieFoodie" option for small scale sellers like small tea shops, women who make homemade chocolates or other small scale setups who wish to sell online.
